## Closing thoughts
In addition to fulfilling the requirements set out by the project, we wanted to achieve the following:
- To allow each team member to identify and explore the areas of development they are interested in.
- To focus on mastering the basic concepts.

To meet the above, we designed the system such that it just meets the key requirements of the project without additional functions, so that every member can have more time mastering the basics in their assigned components.

try for Test Driven Development for the next project.
